ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @GameIsVeryGood, but there are people who call me Rita, like the name my mother chose for me when I was born.
- I'm here to share some code and to discover so many beautiful programmers.
- I am 18 years old and I am about to take the high school diploma from I.T.I.S. "A. Volta" of Naples.
- I don't use social media a lot, but you can find me on Instagram: @rita_esempio
